# Blinkit_UI
This Blinkit-inspired UI, built using Flutter, features a search bar, dynamic category scrolling, and reusable custom widgets. It focuses on responsive design, state management, and modular UI development. The project helped improve my skills in creating modern, interactive, and cross-platform mobile apps.

 ## About the Project
 
This project is a Blinkit-inspired UI developed using Flutter, a modern framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. The primary focus of this project was to replicate the design and user interface of the Blinkit app to understand and practice key aspects of Flutter development:

**Key Features** 

**Widget-based Architecture:**
The UI leverages reusable widgets like Container, Row, Column, and custom widgets (e.g., Uihelper) to build a clean and modular design. 

**State Management:**  Managed the dynamic data for categories, mega deals, and grocery sections using Dart collections like lists and maps.

**Horizontal and Vertical Scrolling:** Implemented scrollable views for categories and deals using SingleChildScrollView to enhance user experience and present data efficiently.

**Responsive Design:** Ensured adaptability to different screen sizes using flexible layout widgets and proper padding/margin techniques.

**Custom Styling:** Applied unique styles, including background colors, custom fonts, and image integration, to mimic the professional look of an e-commerce app.

**Features Implemented**

**Search Bar:**  Provides a sleek and functional search bar for user convenience.

**Category Scrolling:**  Displays product categories in a horizontally scrollable format.

**Dynamic Data Handling:**  Integrated a structured data model using Dart for easy management and expansion of categories.

**Custom Images and Icons**:  Added placeholders for product images and relevant icons to enhance visual appeal.

**Technologies Used**

**Flutter Framework:**  For cross-platform development.

**Dart Language:**  For logic and state management.

**Custom Widgets:**  Reusable components for consistent UI design.

**Purpose**

This project was created as a learning exercise to gain hands-on experience with:


**Flutter's widget system**

**UI design principles**

**Efficient data handling for real-world mobile applications**

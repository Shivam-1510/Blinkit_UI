# Blinkit_UI
This Blinkit-inspired UI, built using Flutter, features a search bar, dynamic category scrolling, and reusable custom widgets. It focuses on responsive design, state management, and modular UI development. The project helped improve my skills in creating modern, interactive, and cross-platform mobile apps.
